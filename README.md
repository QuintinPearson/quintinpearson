### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Quintin Pearson

I am an active tech enthusiast and enjoy all that the industry has to provide. I have worked as a support technician for a few years and then moved on to web development. Although I love this industry, I am no robot, some of my favourite things to do are cooking, gardening and cycling.
